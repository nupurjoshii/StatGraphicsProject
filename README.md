Objective : How has the conversation around cryptocurrencies (crypto) changed over the past 4 years (via Twitter data) - and is that conversation impacting market cap? 

Sub Goals:
1. General sentiment around crypto ( ( positive, negative, neutral? ) and its evolution over time.

2. Are people's opinions more subjective (emotional? ) or objective? ( neutral, facts )

3. Sentiment analysis in response to every announcement ( positive, negative, neutral? )

4. Is twitter sentiment consistent with price changes? 

5. Any correlation between tweet volume to price changes? Is tweeting volume high/low before price drops/rises? Does it matter who tweets and what they tweet (ie are there market movers by their tweets eg. Elon Musk)?
