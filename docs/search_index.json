These cryptocurrencies are powered by the underlying technology of blockchains, which register every transaction and cannot be altered. Different blockchains support different kinds of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, for instance, lives on the bitcoin blockchain; ether exists on the ethereum blockchain. Many leading investors hate cryptocurrency; Warren Buffett has called bitcoin “rat poison squared.” Others, including hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, have climbed aboard. It’s challenging for a casual observer or a “normie” to disentangle the hype from any true potential. Yet, it’s also difficult to shake that feeling: Are digital tokens worthy of a spot in my portfolio? Is it even possible for them to be a viable asset class? We wanted to find out - what is driving this massive momentum in cryptocurrencies now and how does it compare to the global markets? The purpose of this project is to conduct an exploratory analysis of cryptocurrency price trends, trading volume, and the influence of social media and cryptocurrency-related conversations on the market capitalization of these prices. Additionally, we wish to compare cryptocurrency as an asset class to the global stock, bond, and gold markets.

Nota bene: Because cryptocurrency markets do not have set trading hours and do not close for holidays or weekends, we receive daily data from 12am to 11:59pm. The S&amp;P500 and DJI, on the other hand, are only traded Monday through Friday during fixed market hours. 2.2 Data Sources 2.2.1 Cryptocurrency Daily Price Obtained from https://www.investing.com/ in a csv format. Contains Volume, opening price, high, low for each crypto currency. 2.2.2 S&amp;P500 and Dow Jones Index daily Price and Volume Scraped from NASDAQ using Quandl library. NASDAQ being the official marketplace for financial and economic data,was the most reliable and efficient source. Contains Volume, opening price, closing price, high, low for each index 2.2.3 MarketCap Data of Popular Crypto Currencies Obtained from https://www.coingecko.com/ - using the library geckor. They were several sources of marketcap data, the most popular being coinmarketcap - however API calls were expensive and not freely available. Coinmarketcap is the one stop source for all crypto data, for paid/premium users. Coingecko is a close alternative but doesnt provide globalmarketcap data. Because of the price point, and the necessity of global market capitalization data for our analysis, I manually obtained global market capitalization data from coinmarketcap and rendered it into a csv file - which has been separately uploaded to the git repository. 2.2.4 Twitter Data The academicTwitter library is only available upon request to some users and the regular Twitter developer API doesnt provide historical data beyond 7 days. We tried scraping mentions on twitter per keyword, but each callback only allowed for 1500 tweets and limited us to 1 million tweets per day - which wouldnt have allowed us to obtain tweet_count by keyword for the last 2 years. The data was finally obtained by scraping a publicly available graph on bitinfocharts using python( added separately to git repository ) and the data was rendered into a csv file - which was then used to analyse count of tweets for the keywords - ethereum, dogecoin and bitcoin. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We extracted most of the data by scraping NASDAQ marketplace, publicly available graphs and free-data available for financial data of the cryptocurrencies. All of the data was rendered into csv files before treating them - as we were looking at a static data frame. Date formats were corrected to make them uniform in R and missing values were dropped. The only case where we encountered missing values were in the file containing ethereum prices, but entire rows were empty instead of values. Hence the decision was made to drop them. Tweet count was obtained from charts into a csv, and index prices were scraped from NASDAQ into a csv. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Nearly all the data that we loaded did not have missing values. When comparing the Dow Jones Index and the S&amp;P 500 to that of the cryptocurrency prices, there are some days on which there are no price values. This is due to the market not being open. This however does not effect the price of the DJI or SP500 on those days as it just continues on the next open market day from where it had stopped. The large amount of data points make it such that these “missing points” are not visible. Moreover, when computing the correlation heatmap these data points proved to be an issue, so we had to get rid of them. In our Interactive Plot Section, we have News data forselect months, but because of the data format it is set to the beginning of that month. Thus, there are many NA values because there is nothing to report.

With a market cap of approximately 67 billion, Dogecoin alone is worth more than 75% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500. Although digital currencies have grown in popularity in recent months, they remain a small part of the global markets for stocks, bonds, and gdp. The above graphs show the cryptocurrency market share by coin and also the crypto market versus the stock market. There is still a long way to go to close that gap. 5.2 Newer Entrants Are the Top Drivers of Cryptocurrency Growth We weren’t surprised to discover that Bitcoin accounted for most of the growth of the cryptocurrency market in aggregate, but it was surprising to see that Bitcoin has rapidly lost market share to these other cryptocurrencies in recent months. Ether accounts for the first leg of that lopsided growth. And though altcoins like Cardano , Binance coin and Dogecoin are often overlooked, their market share has grown substantially over the past months, and we will examine them below. 5.3 With great returns come great volatility Much of the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies has been self-fulfilling. During the pandemic, trading volume increased as a growing number of investors gained access to crypto markets via a variety of platforms. Investors see incredible gains and enter the market, putting additional upward pressure on prices. However, every breathtaking rally has been followed by an equally punishing crash, and cryptocurrencies lack a fundamental anchor like the par value of a bond or the discounted cash flows of a stock. In the three graphs above we can see the price trends of each of the cryptocurrencies individually: Ether has experienced sharp spikes and tumbles in its price as enthusiasts speculated on a wide variety of applications for the ethereum blockchain like NFT. Bitcoin’s rise and fall seem to be cyclical, but trending upwards. Doge had a meteoric rise and then nearly as catastrophic a fall but has since stabilized. The main use for it as a coin seems to baffle many investors as it is still mainly up there due to its initial “meme status”. While the above graph shows just how far ahead price wise Bitcoin is, it also emphasizes via the Index and Percentage Change Charts how much Dogecoin flew, while the rest of the coins were much more stable, and much less volatile. We can also examine this via the distribution of the percentage change. This is represented below in a boxplot. 5.3.1 Percentage Change Distribution: Crypto Market Doge just has an incredible distribution with so many outliers far right. This is mainly due to that sudden boom period that it experienced; much of it can be owed to social media. 5.4 The Power of Social Media via Twitter The rise of dogecoin has defined the power of memes more than any other move in digital-currency markets. It is a cryptocurrency that was created as a joke but has since risen more than 10,000% by 2021. Dogecoin’s total market value soared to more than $80 billion at its peak in 2021. Dogecoin’s wild swings should serve as a cautionary note to bitcoin investors as well. While the early supporters of cryptocurrency emphasized its utility as an inflation hedge or a store of value, it has no long-term history as either, and its value is heavily influenced by sentiment and momentum. If sentiment turns against it, the price may fall, and a rising price is bitcoin’s most appealing feature to new investors. We aimed to evaluate or look at this by looking at the frequency of tweets from Twitter. Over the past two years we have seen a heavy increase in the number of mentions. Doge has a very large peak which here we can see occurs before the large price peaks. This can be an indication that it takes time for sentiment to gather and develop into action and investment. These mentions could possibly be used as a precursor or a predictor for what next alternative cryptocurrency might gather momentum and boom. 5.5 Twitter Correlation Heatmap Below we examine a correlation heatmap between the % change in tweet frequency and the prices of the three cryptocurrencies of BTC, ETH, and DOGE. As observed in the heatmap above, there does not seem to be any strong correlation apparent. This could be due to the fact that we had observed earlier that the hike in tweet frequency volume precedes the price hike and do not occur simultaneously. We can also observe any correlations, if they exist, between cryptocurrency prices. This is shown in the graphic below. 5.6 Cryptos Price Correlation As we can see here, the prices are very highly correlated in the cryptocurrency market place. Bitcoin and Dogecoin have a relatively low correlation of 0.721; this could be due to the fact that institutions view one as something stable and one as a joke or “meme”. 5.7 Stock Market While the cryptomarket certainly boomed over the course of the pandemic and the last two years, it is equally important to examine that of the stock market as these two avenues are the ones most commonly used as investment areas. It also serves to look at how a tradiitonal market fares against a new and upcoming one. The above graphs do not give much insight other than the fact that they are nearly mirroring each other. The graph on the far right is the exception as we thin of that as the Index’s Price. However, the Relative Index and Percentage Change graph show nearly indistinguishable plots. The middle plot shows the volatility range of the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500. While there was a large spike in the negative and positive directions early on caused by pandemic undertainty and unrest, the fluctuation settled down in the &lt; |5%| range. We can observe this distribution in the Boxplot below. The candlestick charts below show the opening and closing price change over time for the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Index. As seen earlier, the trends they follow are extremely similar. 5.8 Cryptos and Stocks Correlation Mapping a correlation heatmap with respect to percentage change can give us an accurate idea of the correlations between these cryptocurrencies and the stock market. 5.8.1 Percentage Change Heatmap Using % change instead of price quiets down the correlations we saw earlier. Bitcoin and Ethereum are closely linked and have the highest correlation coefficients as they are the crypto market cap leaders. Moreover, Doge is isolated with much smaller values than the rest. Its meme period definitely attributed to this as its percentage change soared, the others did not change nearly as much. We can also confirm what we saw previously in that the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 are very much in sync. In addition, the correlation between the stock market representatives and the cryptos are effectively 0, showing no change or relationship with respect to each other. 5.8.2 Index Heatmap Another version of our correlation heatmap can be computed by using the concept of a relative index we have used earlier in this chapter. The Index version is useful because it essentially shows us a return over time from the beginning of our data, instead of a daily % change. This shows that there is a high degree of correlation between both the stock market and the crypto market. This could mean many things such as equilibrium over time and increased acceptance of the crypto market like the stock market. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component The interactive plot component below overlays significant news event in the cryptocurrency world over the stacked line chart by market capitalizations of the five crypto currencies we studied. As the news was gathered on a per month basis, news warnings will only appear, if they exist, on the 1st day of a month when hovering over that area. The market capitilization % data here is as a percentage of the five currencies in the graph, not as a % of the total cryptocurrencies in circulation as that data was hard to obtain historical data for. While we know Bitcoin has been the most dominant cryptocurrency over these years, it is apparent in this graph how its % market capitalization has decreased. While the so called “smaller coins” have gained more market cap. The sections of Doge, Cardano and Binancecoin grew larger as the orange and green Bitcoin and Ethereum sections grew smaller over these past two years; these changes were not very significant, but definetely quite noticeable. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 What We Expect for the Future of Cryptocurrency: 7.2 Future directions and Scope of project :", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 What We Expect for the Future of Cryptocurrency: With a market capitalization of $1.7 trillion, cryptocurrencies can no longer be ignored. The asset class’s rapid growth necessitates both caution and optimism. Despite the fact that cryptocurrency has spawned entire parallel economies in less than 15 years, there are still significant barriers to real-world use cases. In other words, cryptocurrencies are still a young and highly concentrated investment opportunity. Integration with existing systems in financial services and other industries, rather than a rapid takeover, is likely to determine future adoption rates in the space. If that path is followed, investment opportunities will grow at a rate that is only matched by the potential risks. 7.2 Future directions and Scope of project : Some more insights that need to be explored and could prove immensely useful in understanding cryptocurrency trends and understand how it would really be like to hold crypto as an investment : The correlation between crypto-price returns with international developed-markets stocks and how would this correlation be impacted in periods of market stress when liquidity compresses. Bitcoin Hailed as “digital gold” as its fixed supply and decentralized nature have attracted attention from those who believe that it could act as a viable competitor to the bars by doomsday preppers. - but it would be interesting to plot it out and see if this claim holds any intellectual merit.
