# Conclusion

## What We Expect for the Future of Cryptocurrency:

With a market capitalization of $1.7 trillion, cryptocurrencies can no longer be ignored. The asset class's rapid growth necessitates both caution and optimism.

Despite the fact that cryptocurrency has spawned entire parallel economies in less than 15 years, there are still significant barriers to real-world use cases. In other words, cryptocurrencies are still a young and highly concentrated investment opportunity. Integration with existing systems in financial services and other industries, rather than a rapid takeover, is likely to determine future adoption rates in the space. If that path is followed, investment opportunities will grow at a rate that is only matched by the potential risks.
